Kudu-0.1.2
==========

This release should still be considered "pre-alpha".
Animation sequencing is still broken in this release, animation mode can only be used for posing.

This release of Kudu introduces a preferences dialog.
Navigation is now customizable - you can select a preset profile or manually tweak the settings.

The splash screen which was meant to be in the previous release, was infact not there due to a
simple error in the Makefile... this has been rectified.


As with the all releases, feedback, bug reports, suggestions, patches etc.. are welcome.

Thanks in this release goes to:
Manuel Ponce: For designing the new splash screen graphics. (which is actually there this time).
Nemyax: For many feature suggestions, advice and feedback.
