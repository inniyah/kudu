Kudu-0.1.0 released! 30 July 2006
==========================================

Welcome to the second official release of Kudu.
This release should still be considered "pre-alpha".
Animation sequencing is broken in this release, animation mode can only be used for posing.

New Features in Kudu include:
* Import of Wavefront Objects (.obj)
* Support for textures, many image formats supported through use of the GdkPixbuf library.
  i.e. most common formats: bmp, jpeg, tga, png, gif etc.. might differ depending on library version.
* Selectable joints between bones. Moving of joints not correctly implemented yet - attempting to do so will have strange results.
* Startup splash screen!

Improvments or corrections on existing features:
* Moving / rotating bones has no affect on attached skin in "Editor" mode - only in "Animator" mode.
* Bone rotations occur around local/global axes instead of old "longitude/latitude" style.
* Added support for multiple bone attachments per vertex. Old model supported a max of two bones per vertex.
* Replaced axii arrow indicators with RGB circles.
* Numerous bugs fixed. - And probably a few new ones introduced ;-)

Some other stuff perhaps that I've forgotten about... I have got to learn to make more frequent releases...

Basically with this release of Kudu you should be able to:
Import an object in wavefront format, build a skeleton structure, weight the mesh (skin) to the skeleton, save the object,
switch to animation mode and pose your model.

As with the previous release, feedback, bug reports, suggestions, patches etc.. are welcome.

Thanks in this release goes to:
Manuel Ponce: For designing the new splash screen graphics.
Nemyax: For many feature suggestions, advice and feedback.
