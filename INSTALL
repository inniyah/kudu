Compiling and Installing Kudu
=============================

Before attempting to compile Kudu, please first ensure
that you have all the required librarys, you will need:
=======================================================
Gtk+ 2.6.7
http://www.gtk.org/

GtkGLExt 1.0.6
http://gtkglext.sourceforge.net/

You will also An OpenGL capable graphics card with drivers,
or MESA (see http://www.mesa.org/).


Optional, if you do not have these Kudu will simply compile
without some features.
===========================================================
Python 2.4
http://www.python.org/


===========================================================
All required versions are not for certain the minimum under
which Kudu will compile, I have however not tested under
anything less than indicated. If you encounter a problem
whilst compiling, please first verify whether you have
these versions.
===========================================================


Kudu uses the GNU Autoconf tools for compilation,
thus the steps are simple.
=================================================
From a terminal simply cd into the directory where you
placed the Kudu files, and run:

./configure
make
make install

Depending on where you are installing Kudu, and your user privileges,
you might need to run "make install" as root (super user). To accomplish
that you can run:

su -c "make install"

Running "make install" is optional, if you do not wish to install Kudu
into the main file system, you can simple run the binary directly from
the "src" directory... you can even copy it into the top level directory
and run it from there.



*** NOTE: CVS Version: ***
If you are compiling from a CVS checkout, you will need to have the GNU
Autotools installed. You should then be able to build the configure
script by simple running "autoreconf" from the top level kudu directory,
alternatively you can run the tools manually one by one:

autoheader
autoconf
auotmake

Thereafter you should be able to continue as with a normal release.


You can run Kudu with:
======================
/usr/local/bin/kudu

Unless you configured it to install elsewhere.
Of course if /usr/local/bin is in your PATH you can just run: kudu
