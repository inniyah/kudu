Compiling and Installing Kudu
=============================

Before attempting to compile Kudu, please first ensure
that you have all the required librarys, you will need:
=======================================================
Gtk+ 2.6.7
http://www.gtk.org/

GtkGLExt 1.0.6
http://gtkglext.sourceforge.net/

You will also An OpenGL capable graphics card with drivers,
or MESA (see http://www.mesa.org/).


Optional, if you do not have these Kudu will simply compile
without some features.
===========================================================
Python 2.4
http://www.python.org/


===========================================================
All required versions are not for certain the minimum under
which Kudu will compile, I have however not tested under
anything less than indicated. If you encounter a problem
whilst compiling, please first verify whether you have
these versions.
===========================================================


Kudu uses the GNU Autoconf tools for compilation,
thus the steps are simple.
=================================================
From a terminal simply cd into the directory where you
placed the Kudu files, and run:

./configure
make
make install

Depending on where you are installing Kudu, and your user privileges,
you might need to run "make install" as root (super user). To accomplish
that you can run:

su -c "make install"


You can run Kudu with:
======================
/usr/local/bin/kudu

Unless you configured it to install elsewhere.
Of course if /usr/local/bin is in your PATH you can just run: kudu
